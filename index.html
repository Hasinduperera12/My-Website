    <img class="connecter" src="./assets/images/icons8-javascript.gif" alt="glasses & lens" width="60">
    <p class="connecter">JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
      <br>
      <br>
      JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as compared to other languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can easily be embedded with languages like HTML.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is HTML CSS and JavaScript enough to get a job? 
      <br>
      Yes certainly yes… there is no doubt in it. As a fresher if you have to start your career in Web Development these are the technologies you would have to start with.

    <p class="connectt">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is HTML easy to learn?
      <br>
      HTML is perhaps one of the easiest front-end programming languages to master. So if you want to learn HTML, then go for it! With patience and practice, you'll learn to make the most of this popular language.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is HTML CSS and JavaScript enough to get a job? 
      <br>
      Yes certainly yes… there is no doubt in it. As a fresher if you have to start your career in Web Development these are the technologies you would have to start with.

    <p class="connectt">Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is CSS easy to learn?
      <br>
      Is It Hard to Learn CSS? CSS is an easy programming language to learn at a basic level. The CSS technology was designed to be accessible so anyone could create their own styled web pages on the internet. A lot of the syntax you see in CSS will be very familiar when you learn the basic concepts of HTML.

    <img class="connect" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/60/000000/python--v1.png"/>
    <p class="connectt">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.
      <br>
      <br>
      What can I make with Python?
      <br>
      You can use Python to create arcade games, adventure games, and puzzle games that you can deploy within a few hours. You can also code classic games, such as hangman, tic-tac-toe, rock paper scissors, and more with your newly acquired programming skills.
      <br>
      <br>
      Why is Python so popular?
      <br>
      The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.

    <p class="connectt">SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system
      <br>
      <br>
      Can SQL get you a job?
      <br>
      If you're looking for your first job in data, it turns out knowing SQL is even more critical. For data analyst roles, SQL is again the most in-demand skill, listed in 57.4% of all data analyst jobs. SQL appears in 1.5 times as many “data analyst” job postings as Python, and nearly 2.5 times as many job postings as R.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is learning SQL worth it?
      <br>
      Is Learning SQL Worth It? Yes, SQL is worth learning because it's not only simple to learn, but it also continues to be a highly in-demand skill. Besides, a career in SQL is quite lucrative, so any investment of money or time you make today to learn SQL would be well worth it

    <img class="connect" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/60/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo--v1.png"/>
    <p class="connectt">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
      <br>
      <br>
      What is Java used for?
      <br>
      Java can be used to build applications for a wide range of platforms. Desktops, servers, mobile phones, tablets, Blu-ray players, televisions, and web browsers all use Java, and developers can write Java-based applications for any of these platforms.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is Java enough to get a job?
      <br>
      Java might be enough to get a job. However, most jobs require a set of skills. Specialization is helpful, but technical versatility is also critical. For example, you might get a job to write Java code that connects to a MySQL database.
